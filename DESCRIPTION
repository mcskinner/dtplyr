Package: dtplyr
Title: Adapt data.table for Use with Pipes
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R:
    person(given = "Michael",
           family = "Skinner",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),
           email = "m@redbeard.ai")
Description: Stop the holy war between data.table and dplyr,
    you can use both. The pipe operator is best for readable code,
    but data.table excels at performant merges and aggregations.
    These adapters give you the performance you want, when you need it,
    without sacrificing your beautiful pipelines.
